# Linked-Lists
Each program in this repo covers a different problem:

Linked_List_Middle.c - A solution to Leetcode problem 876: Middle of the Linked List
- Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
- If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Merge_Nodes.c - A solution to Leetcode problem 2181: Merge Nodes in Between Zeros
- The head of a singly linked list is given which contains a series of integers separated by 0s. For every two consecutive 0s, merge all the nodes lying between them into a single node whose value is their sum. The modified list should not contain any 0s.
- Return the head of the modified linked list.
- Contraints: The beginning and end of the list will have Node.val == 0. There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.
